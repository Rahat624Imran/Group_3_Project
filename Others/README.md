Our project is a console-based version of the Hangman game that is implemented in the C language.

Within a limited number of attempts, the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters.

The correctly guessed letters are displayed, whereas the mistakes cause a change in the hangman figure.



Features of the program:

* The current state of the word is displayed.
* The frequency of attempts and previous attempts are all recorded and displayed.
* The hangman figure is visualized using ASCII art.
* Input of repeated or wrong guesses are validated accordingly.
